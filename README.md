# Multi-factor auth app

This application is for demonstration purposes; it is not a final/complete application. The duration of an access request is approximately 11 seconds (5 seconds are for collecting the data). This application illustrates how a 3-factor authentication could be achieved:

- something only the user knows - an email/password
- something only the user possessed - a smartwatch
- something only the user is - his gait and heart rate when he wakes
