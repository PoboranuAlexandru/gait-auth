# gait-auth
 This application is for demonstration purposes; it is not a final/complete application. The duration of an access request is approximately 11 seconds (5 seconds are for collecting the data). This application illustrates how a 3-factor authentication could be achieved: \begin{itemize}     \item something only the user knows - an email/password     \item something only the user possessed - a smartwatch      \item something only the user is - his gait and heart rate when he wakes  \end{itemize}
